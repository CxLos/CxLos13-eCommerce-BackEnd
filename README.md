#  CxLos13-eCommerce-BackEnd

## Description
```
This application is a quick model of an ecommerce/ online retail site's back end of a website. The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with working on the backend of applications. The purpose of this project was to create a strong backend application for an online retailer using sequelize to work with SQL databases and give the retailer a competetive edge in the software engineering field. The problem that this project solves is the clutter and disorganization some companies may struggle with if they do not have a team that is proficient in working on the backend of applications. In building this project, I learned how to seed a database using a javascript seeding file to create multiple tables with keys that link them to other tables with the assistance of sequelize, and how to bring it all together into one fully developed, functional, backend application.
